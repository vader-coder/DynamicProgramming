When the Universe was not so out of whack as it is today,
and all the stars were lined up in their proper places, so
you could easily count them from left to right, or top to
bottom, and the larger and bluer ones were set apart, and
the smaller, yellowing types pushed off to the corners as
bodies of a lower grade, when there was not a speck of dust
to be found in outer space, nor any nebular debrisâ€”in
those good old days it was the custom for constructors,
once they had received their Diploma of Perpetual
Omnipotence with distinction, to sally forth ofttimes and
bring to distant lands the benefit of their expertise.
